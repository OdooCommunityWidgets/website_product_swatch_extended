Website Product Swatch Image

This module is currently a work in progress. The plan is to develop a module to extend the default attribute swatches to allow for use of image swatches, icons (eg. font awesome), or SVG's. Comments and suggestions are welcome in the issues section:

TODO (master):
===============
* Add compatibility with website_multi_image
  * Allow for dynamic selection of swatch image assigned by a boolean value in website_multi_image
* Extend functionality to compete with the built-in Magento 1.9.1 functionality for swatches.
